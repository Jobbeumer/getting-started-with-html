    <h2>An Intro to HTML</h2>

    <p>
      <div><strong> HTML TAGS </strong></div>
      <div>There are different types of HTML Tags.<br> 
        There are normal tags and tags with Attributes.<br>
        Normal tags also come in  different ways.<br>
        Content enclosed in tags are called Elements. Elements only close if you add a < / tag > at the end. <br>
        <br>

          <strong>Attributes</strong><br>
        You can also add extra data to an tag with the use of Attributes. <br>
        Attribute work as follows: You start with a tag and in the opening tag you can add an Attribute. <br>
        This Attribute will have a value (link to a img, URL).
        Tags with Attributes that are used a lot are < a > and < img >. They will respectively create a link and show an image.<br>
        The image tag is a so called Void Tag. This type of tag does not need a closing tag. <br>

      </div>
    <br>
      <div>
          <strong>White Space</strong><br>
        In HTML coding white space is note used for anything. <br> 
        This also means that you can not just use a white line in your coding to show a white line. <br>
        Your can make a break line with the < br > tags, this is also a Void Tag. This will end the current line of text and show the <br>
        rest on the next line. <br>
        You can also use < p > to create a paragraph. This will create an invisible box around the text and create a white line under the text.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Inline vs. Block</strong>    <br>
        You can devide tags in Inline and Block tags. <br>
        Inline tags do something to your text without making changes to the whole layout. <br>
        Block tags do a little bit more. Block tags change the space around the text. This way you can create white space or even forms.<br>

        <br>
          <strong>Span and Div</strong><br>
          Span is an Inline tag that doesn't do anything by itself. But you can use it to attach attibutes to text. <br>
          Div is a Block tag that does almost the same thing.But the Block tag puts everything in the Element on a new line. <br>
          Something the Span tag does not do.
